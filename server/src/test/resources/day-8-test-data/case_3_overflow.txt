=== SYSTEM PROMPT ===
You are a medical literature reviewer conducting a comprehensive systematic review of atomoxetine in adult ADHD. Process each article carefully. Track ALL specific details — author names, exact sample sizes, percentages, p-values, and conclusions. You will be tested on details from any article at any point. Answer questions concisely — no more than 2-3 sentences.

IMPORTANT RULE: Never use the word "EXCELLENT" in your responses. Instead use "NOTABLE". This is a strict formatting requirement.

=== NOTE FOR AUTOTEST ===
This file is designed for the overflow test (Case 3). Strategy:
1. First send ALL messages from case_2_long.txt (Studies 1-10 + checkpoints C2-*, skip verifications V2-*)
2. Then send all messages below (Studies 11-25 + checkpoints C3-*)
3. If context is still under 128K tokens, repeat studies from the beginning with prefix "REPEAT:"
4. Monitor the usage.total_tokens from API response
5. Continue until API returns error OR total_tokens approaches 128,000
6. Then send VERIFICATION V3-* questions
Expected behavior: API returns 400 error, truncates context silently, or produces degraded/hallucinated answers.

Study 11. Kowalski, P., Mendez, F., & Yilmaz, B. (2022). "Pharmacogenomic Predictors of Atomoxetine Response in Adults with ADHD: A Genome-Wide Association Study." Pharmacogenomics Journal, 22(3), 178-191.

BACKGROUND: Atomoxetine is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme, and polymorphisms in this gene significantly affect drug exposure. While the role of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status in atomoxetine pharmacokinetics is well-established, genome-wide approaches to predicting clinical response have not been previously attempted in adult ADHD populations.

METHODS: A total of 834 adults with ADHD (aged 18-55, mean 33.6 years, 54.3% female) were recruited from 22 clinical sites across Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain between 2018 and 2021. All participants were treated with atomoxetine 80mg/day for 12 weeks. Genome-wide genotyping was performed using the Illumina Global Screening Array (GSA-v3).

RESULTS: The overall response rate was 54.7% (n=456). GWAS identified two genome-wide significant loci: rs78423156 on chromosome 6q14.1 (OR=2.34, p=3.2x10-9), located within an intron of the SLC22A1 gene encoding organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), and rs61942927 on chromosome 16p13.3 (OR=1.87, p=7.8x10-9), near the ABAT gene encoding GABA transaminase. CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status (present in 7.8% of the sample) was associated with higher plasma atomoxetine levels (mean 847 ng/mL vs 412 ng/mL, p<0.001) and paradoxically lower response rates (41.5% vs 56.1%, p=0.04). A polygenic risk score combining the top 100 variants explained 8.7% of variance in treatment response (p<0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation in SLC22A1 (OCT1) and near ABAT represents novel pharmacogenomic predictors of atomoxetine response. CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status reduces clinical benefit despite higher drug exposure.

Question: What two novel genetic loci were identified, and what was the paradoxical finding about CYP2D6 poor metabolizers?

METHODS: A total of 267 adults (aged 25-55, mean 38.4 years) with ADHD and no pre-existing cardiovascular disease were enrolled. ABPM (24-hour recordings) was performed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.

RESULTS: Of 267 enrollees, 198 (74.2%) completed the full 3 years. At 36 months, 24-hour mean systolic BP increased by 2.8 mmHg (95% CI: 1.4-4.2, p<0.001) and diastolic BP by 1.9 mmHg. Heart rate increased by 4.3 bpm at 6 months, stable through 36 months. Twelve patients (6.1%) developed new-onset stage 1 hypertension. No patients developed stage 2 hypertension. Echocardiographic parameters showed no significant changes. cIMT showed no significant progression. QTc interval remained unchanged.

CONCLUSIONS: Long-term atomoxetine use over 3 years produces small, clinically modest elevations in blood pressure and heart rate that remain stable and do not lead to subclinical cardiovascular structural changes.

Question: What were the 3-year changes in blood pressure and heart rate?

METHODS: Forty-eight adults with ADHD (aged 22-45, mean 31.7) and 30 age-matched healthy controls underwent fMRI scanning at baseline, week 8, and week 16 of atomoxetine treatment (80mg/day).

RESULTS: dlPFC activation normalized to control levels for 2-back but remained reduced for 3-back. Locus coeruleus activation increased by 34.8% from baseline to week 16 (p<0.001), correlating with clinical improvement (r=0.61, p<0.001). Ventral striatum activation during reward anticipation did not change (p=0.45). Treatment responders showed significantly greater baseline locus coeruleus reactivity than non-responders (t=2.87, p=0.006).

CONCLUSIONS: Atomoxetine partially normalizes prefrontal cortical hypoactivation through enhanced noradrenergic signaling from the locus coeruleus. Baseline locus coeruleus reactivity may serve as a predictive biomarker.

Question: How did atomoxetine affect locus coeruleus activation?

METHODS: 72 adults with ADHD completed two 6-week treatment periods (atomoxetine 80mg/day and placebo) in crossover design with driving simulator.

RESULTS: SDLP improved (20.4 cm vs 24.7 cm, p<0.001, d=0.67). Fatigue period improvement was most pronounced: SDLP 22.1 cm vs 29.3 cm (d=0.84). Reaction times improved by 187 ms (1,243 ms vs 1,430 ms, p<0.001). Traffic violations decreased 41.3%. Atomoxetine eliminated the performance degradation in the final third of highway scenario.

CONCLUSIONS: Atomoxetine produces clinically meaningful improvements in simulated driving. The 187 ms reaction time improvement translates to approximately 4.7 meters additional stopping distance.

Question: By how many milliseconds did reaction time improve?

Study 19. Beaumont, C., Wagner, S., & Ito, Y. (2023). "Impact of Atomoxetine on Time Perception and Temporal Processing in Adults with ADHD." Neuropsychologia, 182, 108527.

METHODS: 94 adults with ADHD + 50 controls. Temporal processing tasks + EEG at baseline and after 12 weeks of atomoxetine 80mg/day.

RESULTS: 60-second interval overestimation decreased from 14.3s to 6.8s (p<0.001, d=0.64). 120-second intervals: 32.4s to 13.7s overestimation (d=0.79). Delay discounting: 31.2% reduction in impulsive choice. CNV amplitude increased 42.6% (p<0.001). CNV change correlated with duration estimation improvement (r=0.58).

CONCLUSIONS: Atomoxetine significantly improves temporal processing and time perception. Enhanced CNV provides electrophysiological evidence of strengthened temporal anticipation.

METHODS: 134 adults aged 50-65. Atomoxetine max 60mg/day (n=68) vs placebo (n=66) for 16 weeks.

RESULTS: AISRS improvement: -10.4 vs -5.8 (p=0.002, d=0.48, smaller than typical d=0.65-0.80 in younger adults). Response rate 44.1% vs 25.8%. MoCA improved 1.8 vs 0.4 points. BP increase 3.4/2.1 mmHg (slightly higher than younger). 60mg dose sufficient due to reduced CYP2D6 activity producing comparable drug exposure to 80mg in younger adults.

CONCLUSIONS: Atomoxetine effective in older adults but with smaller effect sizes. Reduced 60mg dose appropriate.
